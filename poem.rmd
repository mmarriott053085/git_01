## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Little maidens, when you look
On this little story-book,
Reading with attentive eye
Its enticing history, 
Never think that hours of play

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,
The road is forlorn all day,
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,
And the hoof-prints vanish away.
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: 
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright— 
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night. 
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun 
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done— 
“It’s very rude of him,” she said,
“To come and spoil the fun!”

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In shadows deep, where moonlight wanes,
A specter walks, alone in chains. 
Through haunted halls and corridors, 
The echoes of lost love implore.

A raven’s cry in midnight’s air, 
Whispers secrets of despair. 
Within the chamber of my mind, 
A tortured soul, forever bind.

Beneath the weight of sorrow’s cloak,
A heart once vibrant, now bespoke.
In cryptic verse, the verses weep, 
A dirge for dreams in darkness sleep.

The pendulum swings with measured dread, 
Each tick and tock, the thread of thread. 
A dance with fate in the pale moon’s glow,
In riddles, shadows ebb and flow.

The masquerade of phantom’s grace,
In pallid mask, I seek the trace. 
Of memories lost in haunted dreams, 
Where reality and nightmare gleams.

The telltale heart beats, a drumming knell,
In chambers where the shadows dwell.
A macabre ballet of silent cries,
Beneath the sable, where darkness lies.

Quoth the raven, nevermore,
As shadows dance upon the floor. 
In the kingdom of the forlorn,
A soul in mourning, left to mourn.

The raven’s wing, a midnight cloak,
Enshrouds the secrets that evoke. 
A tapestry of midnight lore, 
In veins of ink, forevermore.
